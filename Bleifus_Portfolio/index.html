 			<p>This website includes examples of my work in Ms. Chang's Web Design and Development I class. It also includes my reflections (below) on what i learned in each unit of this course</p>
 	
 	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
 	<img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-2-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>
 	<p>n this unit i learned how to use a lot of the html codes. I also learned how to add videos to my website and how to place a an image to replace the vidoe while its loading. </p>

 	<h2>Unit 3</h2>
 	<p>In this unit I learned many parts of CSS such as changing my text and my backgound color to make my website look cleaner and better. Using CSS helped me understand what goes into making a website and what is required to make a cleaner website. Understanding how to make something highlight when you hover over it with the mouse or adding borders and color and changing the size of thing has helped my website and ive learned from it.</p>

 	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
 	<p>This section will be completed soon.</p>

 	<h2>Unit 5</h2>
 	<p>In this unit I learned a bit of java script and how to make my page interact with the user. Such as when you open my webiste it can say "hello world" or when you click a button on my site it can say that. I also put a clock on my page and learned how to hide and it and make it appear when a button is clicked. I also figured how to put buttons on my video and improve it with style and how to make it all work together.</p>

 	<h2>Unit 6</h2>
 	<p>This section will be completed soon.</p>

 	<h2>Unit 7</h2>
 	<p>This section will be completed soon.</p>
